## Wireframes
#### Crazy Taxi is a one page app with the game screen being in the center of the page and the navbar being on the top of the page. The navbar has links to my Github and LinkedIn. 

#### Once you click on the start button, you will see the next screen with Instructions. You will always be able to access the instructions page by clicking the question icon on the top right of the game screen.

#### Once you learn how to play the game, you can then click start one more time to actually play the game! You can choose to mute if you don't want to hear sound.

#### Lastly, this is the game over page. You can hit ENTER to play again, or click the HOME button to go the main page.
